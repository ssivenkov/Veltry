						All orders shipped outside the United States (including Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico) will be shipped via USPS Global Express Mail, Priority Mail, UPS, or FedEx at our option. If none of these options are available, your package will be shipped using airmail. International orders may sometimes require additional processing time, so our same day delivery guarantee does not apply. You will receive an email from us when your package has been shipped. In some cases, it is impossible to specify the exact delivery date, but most parcels arrive within 1 week from the date of dispatch.
						<br>
						<br>
						International clients are responsible for all customs fees, duties, and other fees associated with the import of our products. If you choose not to pay these shipping fees, we reserve the right to charge these fees to your credit card.
						<br>
						<br>
						Our shipping charges for international orders vary by product and region. Rates usually range from $ 24.99 to $ 79.99. Each additional unit will be charged an additional fee at a reduced rate.
						<br>
						<br>
						In some rare cases, we have to pay a higher shipping cost than stated on our website for shipments to certain regions. In these cases, we will notify the customer prior to dispatching the item that they will be billed for additional shipping charges. The buyer will have the option to accept payment or cancel the order.
						<br>
						<br>
						We do not provide refunds for international orders. If your item is damaged, you must report it to us within 30 days from the date the item was shipped. We will replace any damaged item with a new one of the same model. The buyer will be responsible for all shipping costs if we have to replace the item.
						<br>

						Best regards, Veltry team.
